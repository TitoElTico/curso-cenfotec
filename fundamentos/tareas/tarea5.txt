Exercises #5

In each of these exercises, apply the use of constants, custom functions with parameters 
and return values, if statements, while, or for loops, and vector arrays if required.

Keep any function definition on a separate .h file, and any function 
implementation on a separate .cpp file.

1. Write a program that converts a range of Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius. 
   The program should ask the user for the starting and ending Fahrenheit temperatures, 
   as well as the size of the step between each temperature to be converted. 
   
   The program should then print out a table of conversions from Fahrenheit to Celsius, 
   with each line of the table showing the Fahrenheit temperature, the corresponding 
   Celsius temperature, and then a newline.

	To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, use the formula:

	Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

	For example, if the user enters a starting temperature of 32, an ending temperature 
	of 212, and a step size of 20, the program should produce the following output:
	
	Fahrenheit  Celsius
	-------------------
	 32         0
	 52         11.11
	 72         22.22
	 92         33.33
	112         44.44
	132         55.55
	152         66.66
	172         77.77
	192         88.88
	212         100

	Note that the Fahrenheit temperatures should be right-aligned in the table, and that 
	the Celsius temperatures should be displayed with two digits after the decimal point.

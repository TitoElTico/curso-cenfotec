Exercises #6

In these exercise, apply as many modern C++ as possible.

Keep any function, struct or enumeration definition on a separate .h file, and any
implementation on a separate .cpp file.

- Exercise: Count Lines, Paragraphs, and Words in a Text File

	- Objective: Write a C++ program that reads a text file and counts the total 
	  number of lines, paragraphs, and words in the file. The program should then 
	  print out the counts for each of these.

	- Input: A text file (with extension .txt) containing one or more paragraphs of 
	  text. The file may contain empty lines or lines with only spaces.

	- Output: The program should print out the total number of lines, paragraphs, 
	  and words in the file.

- Requirements
	
	- The program should prompt the user to enter the name of the text file to be read.
	- The program should then read the text file and count the number of lines, paragraphs, 
	  and words in the file.
	- A line is defined as any sequence of characters that ends with a newline character.
	- A paragraph is defined as any sequence of lines that is separated by one or more 
	  empty lines or lines with only spaces.
	- A word is defined as any sequence of non-space characters that is surrounded by spaces 
	  or the beginning/end of a line or paragraph.
	- The program should print out the total number of lines, paragraphs, and words in the file.
	- The program should handle any errors that may occur during the file reading process 
	  (such as file not found).

- Tips

	- You can use the std::ifstream class to read a text file.
	- You can use the getline() function to read each line of the file.
	- You can use a std::vector container to store the lines of the file and iterate 
	  through them to count the paragraphs and words.
	- You can use the std::stringstream class to split a line into words.
	- You can use exception handling to handle any errors that may occur during the file 
	  reading process.
	- You can test your program on different text files to ensure it works correctly.
	- You can use this website to generate some text to test on files. https://en.lipsum.com/

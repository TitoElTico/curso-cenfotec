Exercises #4

In each of these exercises, the use of custom functions with parameters, if statements, while loops, 
and vector arrays is required. Keep any function definition on a separate .h file.

1. Write a program that reads a list of integers from the user and stores them in a vector. 
   The program should then pass this vector to a function that finds and returns the largest 
   and smallest values in the vector. Finally, the program should print these values to the screen.

2. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess 
   the number. If the user's guess is too low, the program should print "Too low! Guess again." 
   If the user's guess is too high, the program should print "Too high! Guess again." If the user 
   guesses the number correctly, the program should print "Congratulations, you guessed the number!"

3. Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the string with all vowels removed. 
   The program should define a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the modified string. 
   The program should then read a string from the user, pass it to the function, and print the modified string to the screen.


For random ypu cas use, the following function definition.

#include <random>

int randomInt(int n, int m)
{
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 mt(rd());

    std::uniform_int_distribution<> distr(n, m);
    return  distr(mt);
}
